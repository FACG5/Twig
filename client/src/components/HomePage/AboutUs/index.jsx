            Twig is a database of common medical questions translated by
            volunteer medical professionals and other translators. Twig
            volunteers also verify each translationâ€™s quality, and may add new
            questions to the system. Once verified multiple times, translations
            are made available to medical professionals to use. In this way Twig
            is a typical crowdsourced wiki whose vision is directed by its
            members.
